This blog will serve as my research notebook where I will record my ideas,
reading, and progress in research.  It is powered by the `Pelican` static site
generator and uses the `liquid-tags` plugin that Jake VanderPlas created for
the Octopress theme.  This means we can easily embed IPython notebooks into
posts, there just needs to be a copy of the notebook in the
`content/notebooks/` directory.

That seems to be about enough for now.
