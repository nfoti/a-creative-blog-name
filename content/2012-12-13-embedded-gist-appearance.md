Title: Embedded gist appearance

Some of the posts on this blog include embedded gists to display code.
Apparently GitHub has changed something about gists and now the syntax
highlighting is all messed up.  Hopefully there will be a fix in the 
near future, but in the mean time we're just going to have
to live with the code looking awful.  As a quick fix I will not embed
gists in posts until this issue has been fixed.

There is an issue at the octopress repostiory on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/847) that you can follow
to be updated on any progress.

*Update:* This blog doesn't use octopress anymore, so this may or may not 
be a problem anymore.
